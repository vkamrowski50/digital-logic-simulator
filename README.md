# digital-logic-simulator

A project on simulating basic digital logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR) in Python. Contains unit tests.
Made entirely by Victor Kamrowski.

## How to Run

to be added

## Future Plans

Add more gates such as NOR and XNOR. Add multiplexers, decoders, and more combinational circuits.
Simulate memory components through sequential logic elements such as flip-flops and latches.
Develop GUI to visually design and test digital circuits.
Add ability to simulate large scale digital systems through chaining gates.
Logging/debugging features ???
Export designs (HDLs???) ???
