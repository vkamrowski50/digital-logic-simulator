# Digital Logic Simulator

Python-based simulator for digital logic circuits. Built entirely from the ground up by **Victor Kamrowski**. This simulator models logic gates and combinational circuits. Uses object-oriented design and unit tests.

## âœ¨ Features

- Logic gate simulations for:
  - AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR
- Combinational Circuits:
  - Half Adder, Full Adder (more to come)
- Object-oriented design / architecture
- Unit tests with 'unittest'

## ðŸš€ How to Run

to be added

## Future Plans

- more combinationals (multiplexers, decoders, ALUs, ...)
- sequential logic (flip-flops, latches, counters and registers, ...)
- gui for circuit design
- debugging tools
- export to HDLs eventually
